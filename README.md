mcbenchviz
==========

McBenchViz is a Google Chrome app for interactive exploration of performance characteristics of complex software configurations. It is initially intended for peformance evaluation of a family of high-performance compilers for MATLAB that are being developed at the McGill Compilation Lab, McLab.

The current version connects to McBenchJS, a node server that automates running performance experiments on multiple configurations of software and hardware and that provides a unified interface to past results.
